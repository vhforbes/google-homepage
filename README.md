The Odin Project: google-homepage

20/05/2020

I'm one week in The Odin Project course.

In this project my main focus was to clone Google.com. 

The main rule was that I should not inspect the source code from the site.

I created the layot only looking at the homepage.

My goal was to see how much html and css I had learned until now.

I went into some roadbloacks and know that there are some things yet to be improved.

Nonetheless I was verry satysfied to be able to acomplish this with only one Week of consistent study. I'm sure that the more I trie to do, the easier will be to make the design decisions that are on my muind.
